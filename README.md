# Blockchain Developer Bootcamp Final Project
## Project Idea: Vehicle Title Ownership
1. Users will have to register themselves on the contract.
  * Not sure exactly what that means, but they need to be a part of the network to vote on the next transaction, so I think this just means join the network.
2. When ownership of a vehicle is transferred, if more than one is transferred in a similar timeframe, users will have to identify which vehicle transfer they want to vote for.
3. They have to submit a vote for that vehicle transfer (transaction).
4. Users can't submit two votes during the same voting campaign (can only vote for one vehicle until the block is added, I believe).
